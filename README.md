This script is designed to help a user decide whether it's cheaper to buy gasoline on a Navy base in Japan or off base, based on current gas prices and currency exchange rates.

The program begins by navigating to a website where the price of gas on the Navy base is listed. It retrieves this information and converts the price from dollars per gallon to yen per liter.

Next, it visits another website to get the current exchange rate between the US dollar and the Japanese yen.

Based on this data, it calculates a threshold price. If the price of gas off base is lower than this threshold, it will be cheaper to buy gas off base. If the price of gas off base is higher than this threshold, it will be cheaper to buy gas on base.

The program then displays this information to the user.

This tool can be highly useful for someone who has the option to buy gas either on or off a Navy base and wants to ensure they're getting the best deal. It can save the user time and effort by automatically gathering and analyzing the necessary data and presenting a clear recommendation.
